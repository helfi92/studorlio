            <h1>New York city Taxi Drive duration</h1>
            <p>To improve the efficiency of taxi dispatching systems for such services, it is important to be able to predict how long a driver will have his taxi occupied. If a dispatcher knew approximately when a taxi driver would be ending their current ride, they would be better able to identify which driver to assign to each pickup request. This project is to build a model that predicts the total ride duration of taxi trips in New York City.</p>

            <ol>
              <h2 id="eda"><li>Dictionary</li></h2>
                <p>Let's check the data files! According to the data description we should find the following columns:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><b>id:</b> a unique identifier for each trip.</li>
                    <li><b>vendor_id:</b>a code indicating the provider associated with the trip record</li>
                    <li><b>pickup_datetime:</b>date and time when the meter was engaged.</li>
                    <li><b>dropoff_datetime:</b>date and time when meter was disengaged.</li>
                    <li><b>passenger_count:</b>the number of passengers in the vehicle (driver entered value)</li>
                    <li><b>pickup_longitude:</b>the longitud where the meter eas engaged</li>
                    <li><b>pickup_latitude:</b> the latitude where the meter was engaged</li>
                    <li><b>dropoff_longitude:</b> the longitude where the meter was disengaged</li>
                    <li><b>dropoff_latitude:</b> the latitude where the meter was disengaged</li>
                    <li><b>store_and_fwd_flag:</b> this flag indicates whether the trip record was held in vehicle memory before sending to the vendor because the vehicle did not have a connection to the server (Y=store and forward; N=not a store and forward trip)</li>
                    <li><b>trip_duration:</b> (target) duration of the trip in seconds</li>
                  </ul>
                <p>Here, we have 2 variables dropoff_datetime and store_and_fwd_flag which are not available before the trip starts and hence will not be used as features to the model.</p>
								<h2 id="colab"><li>Data Analysis</li> </h2>
								<p>Here, you can find googlee Colab notebook: <a href="https://github.com/AlejandroPinto5/EDA-projects/blob/main/NYC-taxi-project/EDA_taxi_proj.ipynb">Data Analysis of NYC taxi trip duration. </a></p>
              <h2 id="con"><li>Conclusions:</li> </h2>
								<ul>
									<li>The majority of rides follow a rather smooth distribution that looks almost log-normal with a peak just around exp(6.5) i.e. about 17 minutes.</li>
									<li>There are several suspiciously short rides with less than 10 seconds duration.</li>
									<li>As discussed earlier, there are a few huge outliers near 12.</li>
									<li>Most of the trips involve only 1 passenger. There are trips with 7-9 passengers but they are very low in number.</li>
									<li>Vendor 2 has more number of trips as compared to vendor 1</li>
									<li>Number of pickups for weekends is much lower than week days with a peak on Thursday (4). Note that here weekday is a decimal number, where 0 is Sunday and 6 is Saturday.</li>
									<li>Number of pickups as expected is highest in late evenings. However, it is much lower during the morning peak hours.</li>
									<li>We see that most trips are concentrated between these lat long only with a few significant clusters. These clusters are represented by the numerous peaks in the lattitude and longitude histograms</li>
									<li>Trip durations are definitely shorter for late night and early morning hours that can be attributed to low traffic density</li>
									<li>It follows a similar pattern when compared to number of pickups indicating a correlation between number of pickups and trip duration</li>
									<li>Median trip duration does not vary much as can be seen from the above plot for different vendors.</li>
									<li>The boxplot clearly shows that there not much of a difference in distribution for the most frequently occuring passenger count values - 1, 2, 3.</li>
									<li>Another key observation is that the number of outliers are reduced for higher passenger counts but that only comes down to the individual frequencies of each passenger count.</li>
									<li>From the correlation heatmap we see that the lattitude and longitude features have higher correlation with the target as compared to the other features.</li>
