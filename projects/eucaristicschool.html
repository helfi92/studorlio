            <h1 id="jes">Analysis of Students Physics Tests for Tenth and Eleventh Grade in High School</h1>
              <p>The following report presents an analysis of the performance of high school students from Jesús Eucaristia School in the area of physics, based on data collected during the year 2021. The objective of this analysis is to evaluate the effectiveness of the school's physics program in preparing students for the Colombian Scholastic Aptitude Test (ICFES), which is a standardized test used to assess the academic performance of students in Colombia. The data includes information on 5 tests taken by 2 courses of 21 students each, for a total of 42 students. The tests cover 4 components of physics (thermodynamics, waves, mechanics, and electromagnetism) and 3 competences (explanation of phenomena, inquiry, and comprehensive use of knowledge). By analyzing this data, we can identify areas of strength and weakness in the school's physics program, and make recommendations for improvement to better prepare students for the ICFES.</p>
              <ol>
                <h2> <li>OVERVIEW OF THE DATA</li></h2>
                There were 5 tests in total, which were taken by 2 courses of 21 students each, for a total of 42 students.
                The data contains the following information for each student and each test:
                <ul>
                  <li>Name of the student.</li>
                  <li>Number of wrong and good answers.</li>
                  <li>Number of questions per test.</li>
                  <li>4 components of physics: thermodynamics, waves, mechanics, and electromagnetism.</li>
                  <li>3 competences: explanation of phenomena, inquiry, and comprehensive use of knowledge.</li>
                  <li>Difficulty of the question.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2><li>OVERALL PERFORMANCE:</li> </h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>To evaluate the overall performance of the students, we can calculate the average score across all tests and all students.</li>
                  <li>We can also calculate the average score for each course separately, and compare them to see if there's any significant difference in performance between the two courses.</li>
                  <li>Additionally, we can analyze the distribution of scores to see if there are any outliers or if the scores are normally distributed.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2><li>PERFORMANCE BY PHYSICS COMPONENT:</li></h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>We can also analyze the performance of students on each physics component separately.</li>
                  <li>We can calculate the average score for each component across all tests and all students, and compare them to see which component the students performed the best or worst in.</li>
                  <li>We can also analyze the distribution of scores for each component to see if there are any differences in performance across the different components.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2><li>PERFORMANCE BY competence:</li></h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>We can also analyze the performance of students on each competence separately.</li>
                  <li>We can calculate the average score for each competence across all tests and all students, and compare them to see which competence the students performed the best or worst in.</li>
                  <li>We can also analyze the distribution of scores for each competence to see if there are any differences in performance across the different competences.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2><li>Difficulty of questions:</li></h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>We can analyze the difficulty of questions to see if there's any correlation between difficulty and student performance.</li>
                  <li>We can calculate the average score for each difficulty level of questions, and compare them to see if students performed better on easier or harder questions.</li>
                  <li>We can also analyze the distribution of scores for each difficulty level to see if there are any differences in performance across the different levels.</li>
                </ul>
                </ol>

                <p>Based on the analysis of the data, we can draw conclusions about the overall performance of the students, as well as their performance on specific components and competences. We can also identify any areas of weakness or strength, and make recommendations for improvement. It's important to note that this analysis is based on a limited amount of data, and further analysis may be needed to fully understand the performance of the students.</p>
